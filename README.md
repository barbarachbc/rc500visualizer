# RC-500 Visualizer

## Overview

RC-500 Visualizer is a web-based tool and WordPress plugin for viewing and exploring RC-500 memory/configuration files. It features a modern UI built with Vue 3 and Bootstrap, and can be used standalone or embedded in WordPress.

## GitHub Copilot Usage

Copilot was used extensively for this project. Markdowns in docs subfolder completely generated by Copilot from screenshots of the pdf documentation ... probably contains errors. Lots of manual work done as well ... simply because sometimes it's faster than fighting with Copilot. If I hadn't used Copilot I would've never attempted doing this so I'll live with imprefections. If I did something totally stupid in here please let me know.

## Features
- Visualize RC-500 memory and parameter files
- Collapsible cards for organized navigation
- Tooltips and icons for parameter details
- Responsive design with Bootstrap 5
- Easy integration as a WordPress shortcode

## Build & Release

- Source files are in `src/`
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run build` to generate minified assets in `dist/`
- Non-JS/CSS/HTML assets in `src/` are copied to `dist/`
- The build process bundles and minifies all JS and CSS, and minifies the HTML

## Local Development

- To serve the app locally, run:
  ```
  npm run start
  ```
- This uses the `serve` package to host the `dist/` folder at `http://localhost:3000` (default)
- Edit files in `src/` and rebuild as needed
- use `npm run startdev` for running directly from src folder

## WordPress Plugin

- The plugin is in `plugin/rc500-visualizer.php`
- After build, all assets for the plugin are in `dist/`
- Copy `rc500-visualizer.php` and the minified assets from `dist/` to your WordPress `wp-content/plugins/rc500-visualizer/` directory
- Activate the plugin in the WordPress admin dashboard
- Use the `[rc500_visualizer]` shortcode in your WordPress site to embed the app

## Folder Structure

```
rc500-visualizer/
├── src/                # Source files (edit here)
├── dist/               # Minified/bundled release files (auto-generated)
├── build/              # Build scripts
├── plugin/             # WordPress plugin files
├── docs/               # Documentation, examples, screenshots
├── assets/             # Images, icons, etc. (optional)
├── .gitignore          # Git ignore file
├── README.md
├── package.json
```

## Deployment

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Copy plugin files and assets to your WordPress site
3. Activate the plugin and use the shortcode

## Troubleshooting
- If you see a blank page, check browser console for errors
- Ensure all assets are present in the plugin directory
- Make sure your JS bundle mounts the Vue app to `#app`
- For local development, rebuild after making changes in `src/`
