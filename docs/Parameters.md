| **LOOP FX** | OFF, **ON**               | Specifies whether to apply LOOP FX (**ON**) or not (**OFF**). |
| **1SHOT**   | **OFF**, ON               | Specifies whether the track playback will be one-shot (**ON**) or not one-shot (**OFF**; conventional loop playback).<br/>**OFF:** Conventional loop playback.<br/>**ON:** The phrase will play only once from the beginning to the end of the track, then stop automatically (One-Shot Playback).<br/>- If you press the REC/PLAY1 switch during playback, playback will begin again from the beginning of the track (Retrigger Playback). Overdubbing cannot be carried out.<br/>- If you don‚Äôt want to use tempo synchronization, set TEMPO.S (p. 3) ‚ÄúOFF.‚Äù<br/>*If 1SHOT is ON, playback will stop when it reaches the end of the phrase.* |
| **LEVEL**   | 0‚Äì**100**‚Äì200                 | Adjusts the playback level of the tracks.<br/>* You can also use the [TRACK 1] and [TRACK 2] sliders to adjust the playback level. |

| **MEASURE** | AUTO, **FREE**, 1MEAS‚Äì        | You can specify the number of measures for each track. When recording along with rhythm sounds or other tracks, it‚Äôs convenient to specify the number of measures before you record, so that looping will occur at the specified measure length, even if you don‚Äôt operate the switch when you‚Äôve finished recording.<br/>* This parameter is available only if LOOPS (p. 3) is ‚ÄúON.‚Äù<br/>**Track 1:** One measure<br/>**Track 2:** Four measures<br/>**AUTO:** Tracks that are set to AUTO will have the same number of measures. The number of measures is determined by the first-recorded track of the tracks that are set to AUTO.<br/>**FREE:** The number of measures will be set automatically, corresponding to the length of the recording.<br/>**1MEAS‚Äì:** The number of measures will be set manually. |
| **LOOPS (LOOP SYNC)**   | OFF, **ON**          | Specifies whether the beginning of the track 1 and track 2 phrases are aligned for loop playback (**ON**), or whether they loop-play at the length of their respective phrases (**OFF**).<br/><br/>**ON:** Retriggers at the beginning of the first-recorded phrase. Playback will repeat at the length of the phrase.<br/>**OFF:** Playback will repeat at the length of each phrase independently.<br/><br/>**Playback starting location:**<br/>If you turn LOOPS on, the beginning of the tracks will always be aligned. If tracks are already playing back, the playback start location of the other tracks will become "the current location of the phrase being played." (See diagram for details.)<br/>With LOOPS OFF, playback always starts at the beginning of the phrase. |
| **TEMPO.S (TEMPO SYNC)**| OFF, **ON**          | Specifies whether each track plays at its original tempo (the tempo during recording) or at the tempo that is specified in memory.<br/><br/>**OFF:** The track will play at its own original tempo.<br/>**ON:** The track will play at the memory tempo. Tracks 1 and 2 play at the same tempo. |
